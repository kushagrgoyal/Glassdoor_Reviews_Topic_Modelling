# Glassdoor Reviews Topic Modelling

## Background & Usability
- This project was built to mainly help me to understand major themes in the Glassdoor reviews for any particular company
- The project includes a scraper so it can scrape any number of pages of Glassdoor reviews given the link for the 1st page of any company
- The main outcome is the top Topics in the "Cons" part of the review
- I wanted the script to be usable quite easily even if you do not know anything about Python or NLP or Topic Modelling
